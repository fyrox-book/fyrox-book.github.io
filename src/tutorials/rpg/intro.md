# Role-Playing Game Tutorial

This tutorial starts the series of tutorials about writing a role-playing game in Rust using Fyrox game engine. Strangely,
but Fyrox has a reputation of an engine for 3D shooters. In this series I'll try to prove that it is a general purpose
game engine.

## Source Code

Source code for the entire tutorial is [available here](https://github.com/fyrox-book/fyrox-book.github.io/tree/main/src/code/tutorials/rpg).

## Engine Version

This tutorial is made using Fyrox 0.33.
