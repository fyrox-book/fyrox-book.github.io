# Text Box

TextBox is a text widget that allows you to edit text and create specialized input fields. It has various options like
word wrapping, text alignment, and so on.

## How to create

An instance of the TextBox widget could be created like so:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:create_text_box}}
```

## Text alignment and word wrapping

There are various text alignment options for both vertical and horizontal axes. Typical alignment values are:
`Left`, `Center`, `Right` for horizontal axis, and `Top`, `Center`, `Bottom` for vertical axis. An instance of
centered text could be created like so:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:create_centered_text}}
```

Long text is usually needs to wrap on available bounds, there are three possible options for word wrapping:
`NoWrap`, `Letter`, `Word`. An instance of text with word-based wrapping could be created like so:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:create_text_with_word_wrap}}
```

## Fonts and colors

To set a color of the text just use `.with_foreground(..)` of the `WidgetBuilder` while building the text instance:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:create_colored_text_box}}
```

By default, text is created with default font, however it is possible to set any custom font:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:create_text_box_with_font}}
```

Please refer to [Font](font.md) chapter to learn more about fonts.

## Shadows

TextBox widget supports shadows effect to add contrast to your text, which could be useful to make text readable
independent on the background colors. This effect could be used for subtitles. Shadows are pretty easy to add, all you
need to do is to enable them, setup desired thickness, offset and brush (solid color or gradient).

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:create_red_text_with_black_shadows}}
```

## Messages

TextBox widget accepts the following list of messages:

- `TextBoxMessage::SelectionBrush` - change the brush that is used to highlight selection.
- `TextBoxMessage::CaretBrush` - changes the brush of the caret (small blinking vertical line).
- `TextBoxMessage::TextCommitMode` - changes the [text commit mode](text_box.md#text-commit-mode).
- `TextBoxMessage::Multiline` - makes the TextBox either multiline (`true`) or single line (`false`)
- `TextBoxMessage::Editable` - enables or disables editing of the text.
- `TextMessage::Text` - sets or gets the new text.
- `TextMessage::Wrap` - sets new [wrapping mode](text.md#text-alignment-and-word-wrapping).
- `TextMessage::Font` - sets new [font](text.md#fonts-and-colors)
- `TextMessage::VerticalAlignment` and `TextMessage::HorizontalAlignment` sets
  [vertical and horizontal](text_box.md#text-alignment-and-word-wrapping) text alignment respectively.
- `TextMessage::Shadow` - enables or disables [shadow casting](text_box.md#shadows)
- `TextMessage::ShadowDilation` - sets "thickness" of the shadows under the tex.
- `TextMessage::ShadowBrush` - sets shadow brush (allows you to change color and even make shadow with color gradients).
- `TextMessage::ShadowOffset` - sets offset of the shadows.

An example of changing text at runtime could be something like this:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:request_change_text}}
```

Please keep in mind, that like any other situation when you "changing" something via messages, you should remember
that the change is **not** immediate. The change will be applied on `ui.poll_message(..)` call somewhere in your
code (or will be done automatically if you're using scripts or Framework (obsolete)).

## Shortcuts

There are number of default shortcuts that can be used to speed up text editing:

- `Ctrl+A` - select all
- `Ctrl+C` - copy selected text
- `Ctrl+V` - paste text from clipboard
- `Ctrl+Home` - move caret to the beginning of the text
- `Ctrl+End` - move caret to the beginning of the text
- `Shift+Home` - select everything from current caret position until the beginning of current line
- `Shift+End` - select everything from current caret position until the end of current line
- `Arrows` - move caret accordingly
- `Delete` - deletes next character
- `Backspace` - deletes previous character
- `Enter` - new line (if multiline mode is set) or `commit` message

## Multiline Text Box

By default, text box will not add new line character to the text if you press `Enter` on keyboard. To enable this
functionality use `.with_multiline(true)`

## Read-only Mode

You can enable or disable content editing by using read-only mode. Use `.with_readonly` at build stage.

## Mask Character

You can specify replacement character for every other characters, this is useful option for password fields. Use
`.with_mask_char` at build stage. For example, you can set replacement character to asterisk `*` using
`.with_mask_char(Some('*'))`

## Receiving Text Changes

TextBox uses `TextMessage::Text` message to send the new text to a user. To get a text from text box you need to
listen to this message:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:text_message}}
```

### Text Commit Mode

In many situations you don't need the text box to send `new text` message every new character, you either want this
message if `Enter` key is pressed or TextBox has lost keyboard focus (or both). There is `with_text_commit_mode` on
builder specifically for that purpose. Use one of the following modes:

- `TextCommitMode::Immediate` - text box will immediately send `Text` message after any change.
- `TextCommitMode::LostFocus` - text box will send `Text` message only when it loses focus.
- `TextCommitMode::LostFocusPlusEnter` - text box will send `Text` message when it loses focus or if Enter key was
  pressed. This is **default** behavior. In case of multiline text box hitting Enter key won't commit text!

## Filtering

It is possible specify custom input filter, it can be useful if you're creating special input fields like numerical or
phone number. A filter can be specified at build stage like so:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/ui/text_box.rs:create_text_box_with_filter}}
```

## Style

You can change brush of caret by using `.with_caret_brush` and also selection brush by using `.with_selection_brush`,
it could be useful if you don't like default colors.
