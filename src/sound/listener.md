# Listener

An audio receiver that captures the sound at a particular point in your scene and sends it to an audio context for
processing and outputting to an audio playback device. Every game scene has only one listener. There's nothing specific
in listener's API, in general it is just an oriented point in 3D space. "Ear" axis is the local X axis.
