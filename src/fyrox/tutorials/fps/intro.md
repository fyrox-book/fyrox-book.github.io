# First-Person Shooter Tutorial

In this tutorial we'll make a 3D shooter - something similar to [rusty-shooter](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-shooter).
Also, the series should help you to learn basic principles which lies in the foundation of the engine.

## fyrox and rusty-editor version

and keep the code compilable over time the versions of both the engine and the editor are set to specific commits 
in the main repo.
