# Decorator (WIP)

A visual element that changes its appearance by listening specific events.
It can has "pressed", "hover", "selected" or normal appearance:

 `Pressed` - enables on mouse down message.
 `Selected` - whether decorator selected or not.
 `Hovered` - mouse is over decorator.
 `Normal` - not selected, pressed, hovered.

This element is widely used to provide some generic visual behaviour for various
widgets. For example it used to decorate button, items in items control.
