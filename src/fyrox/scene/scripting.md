# Scripting

A game based on Fyrox is a plugin to the engine and the editor. Plugin defines global application logic and can provide
a set of scripts, that can be used to assign custom logic to scene nodes. Every script can be attached to only one 
plugin.

Fyrox uses scripts to create custom game logic, scripts can be written only in Rust which ensures that your game will
be crash-free, fast and easy to refactor.

Next chapters will cover all parts and will help you to learn how to use plugins + scripts correctly.
