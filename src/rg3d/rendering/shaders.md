# Shaders

Shader is a set of programs that runs directly on graphics adapter. Each program from the set is called
_sub-shader_. Sub-shaders linked with render pass, each render pass defines "where" to draw and an object.
"where" means that you can set up your own render pass and the renderer will use the sub-shader with 
your render pass. For the ease of use there are number of [predefined render passes](#predefined-render-passes).

Shaders have properties of various types that can be used together with materials to draw an object. 

## Shaders language

The engine uses GLSL shading language for every sub-shader. There are numerous of GLSL guides over the 
internet, so there is no need to "re-post" the well documented info again.

There are very few differences:

1) No need to define a version of the shader. Every shader source will be pre-processed, and it will 
get correct version automatically. Preprocessing is needed because the same shader could run on OpenGL
and WebGL (OpenGL ES) which have some differences.
2) There is a "standard" library of useful methods which is automatically included in every shader source
at preprocessing stage. The library source could be found
[here](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/blob/master/src/renderer/framework/shaders/shared.glsl). It 
is well documented, and you may find some functions useful for you job.

## Structure

Shader has rigid structure that could be described in this code snipped:

```ron
(
    // A set of properties, there could be any amount of properties.
    properties: [
        (
            // Each property must have a name. This name must match with respective
            // uniforms! That's is the whole point of having properties.
            name: "diffuseTexture",
            // Value has limited set of possible variants.
            value: Sampler(default: None, fallback: White)
        )
    ],
    // A set of render passes (see next section for more info)
    passes: [
        (
            // Name must match with the name of either standard render pass (see below) or
            // one of your passes.
            name: "Forward",
            // A set of parameters that regulate renderer pipeline state.
            // This is mandatory field of each render pass.
            draw_parameters: DrawParameters(
                // A face to cull. Either Front or Back.
                cull_face: Some(Back),
                // Color mask. Defines which colors should be written to render target.
                color_write: ColorMask(
                    red: true,
                    green: true,
                    blue: true,
                    alpha: true,
                ),
                // Whether to modify depth buffer or not.
                depth_write: true,
                // Whether to use stencil test or not.
                stencil_test: None,
                // Whether to perform depth test when drawing.
                depth_test: true,
                // Blending options.
                blend: Some(BlendFunc(
                    sfactor: SrcAlpha,
                    dfactor: OneMinusSrcAlpha,
                )),
                // Stencil options.
                stencil_op: StencilOp(
                    fail: Keep,
                    zfail: Keep,
                    zpass: Keep,
                    write_mask: 0xFFFF_FFFF,
                ),
            ),
            // Vertex shader code.
            vertex_shader:
                r#"
                layout(location = 0) in vec3 vertexPosition;
                layout(location = 1) in vec2 vertexTexCoord;
                uniform mat4 rg3d_worldViewProjection;
                out vec2 texCoord;
                void main()
                {
                    texCoord = vertexTexCoord;
                    gl_Position = rg3d_worldViewProjection * vertexPosition;
                }
                "#;
            // Pixel shader code.
            pixel_shader:
                r#"
                // Note that the name of this uniform match the name of the property up above.
                uniform sampler2D diffuseTexture;
                out vec4 FragColor;
                in vec2 texCoord;
                void main()
                {
                    FragColor = diffuseColor * texture(diffuseTexture, texCoord);
                }
                "#;
        )
    ],
)
```

## Properties

Property is a named variable of some type. Properties directly tied with the uniforms in the sub-shaders,
for each you can have a property called `time`, and then you can define `uniform float time;` in your sub-shader
and the engine will pass property value to that uniform for you before drawing an object. Properties placed in 
a "global namespace", which means that every sub-shader have "access" to the properties.

## Built-in properties

There are number of built-in properties, the full list is available
[here](https://docs.rs/fyrox/0.23.1/fyrox/material/shader/struct.Shader.html#built-in-variables)

## Predefined render passes

Predefined render passes helps you to create your own shader without a need to create your own render pass 
and to quickly start writing your shaders.

- **GBuffer** - A pass that fills a set with render target sized textures with various data about each rendered 
object. These textures then are used for physically-based lighting. Use this pass when you want the standard 
lighting to work with your objects.
- **Forward** - A pass that draws an object directly in render target. This pass is very limiting, it does not 
support lighting, shadows, etc. It should be only used to render translucent objects.
- **SpotShadow** - A pass that emits depth values for an object, later this depth map will be used to render shadows.
- **PointShadow** - A pass that emits distance from a fragment to a point light, later this depth map will be used
to render shadows.

## Drawing parameters

Drawing parameters defines which GPU functions to use and at which state. For example, to render transparent
objects you need to enable blending with specific blending rules. Or you need to disable culling to draw objects
from both sides. This is when draw parameters comes in handy. There are relatively large list of drawing
parameters, and it could confuse a person who didn't get used to work with graphics. Thankfully there is a good
documentation about this available [here](https://docs.rs/fyrox/0.23.1/fyrox/material/shader/struct.Shader.html#drawing-parameters)

## Vertex shader

Vertex shader operates on single vertices, it must provide at least the position of the vertex
in clipping space. In other words it has to do at least this:

```glsl
layout(location = 0) in vec3 vertexPosition;

uniform mat4 rg3d_worldViewProjection; // Note the built-in variable.

void main()
{
    gl_Position = rg3d_worldViewProjection * vertexPosition;
}
```

This is the simplest vertex shader, using vertex shaders you can create various graphical effects that affects
vertices.

## Pixel Shader

Pixel shader (or more precisely - fragment shader), operates on a small fragment of your render target. In general
pixels shaders just writes some color to a render target (or multiple targets) using some program.

```glsl
out vec4 FragColor;

void main()
{
    FragColor = vec4(1, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

This is the simplest pixel shader, it just fills the render target with red color.
