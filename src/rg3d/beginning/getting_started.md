# Getting started

Despite the look of it, the engine is quite friendly to newcomers, especially with some good guides. This section
of the book will guide you the basics of the engine.

To begin using the engine, just add following lines to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rg3d = { git = "https://github.com/rg3dengine/rg3d" } 
```
